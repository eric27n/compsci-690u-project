# compsci-690u-project
This Github page houses all of the relevant files for the research project for Dr. Green's COMPSCI 690U [Computational Biology + Bioinformatics] course for Spring 2025. This project evaluates two traditional ML algorithms (BLAST-enhanced kNN, random forests) against different biological foundation models on a DNA sequence classification task from DGEB.

## Instructions
The DGEB-altered dataset used in this paper (MIBiG DNA Classification) can be found at the following link: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/tattabio/mibig_classification_dna](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tattabio/mibig_classification_dna)

* To run the BLAST kNN algorithm, first run the make files notebook, then run the code in the BLAST kNN notebook.
* To run the random forest algorithm, just run the RF notebook.

## File Directory
